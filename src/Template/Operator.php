/**
 * Represents a URI template expression operator,
 *
 * Each operator has a number of different attributes associated with it. They
 * are
 *
 *   - A prefix. If any variables in an expression are defined, then the prefix
 *     inserted in front of the expression's expansion.
 *
 *   - A separator. A string to insert in between the expansions of defined
 *     variables in the expression.
 *
 *   - Whether named parameters are expanded. If so, string-valued variables are
 *     expanded as though the variable name were a key associated with the
 *     value. Similarly, unexploded lists and associated arrays are first
 *     expanded, then inserted into the result with the variable name rendered
 *     though it were a key for the result string. Also, when exploding lists,
 *     the variable name is used as a key for each value in the list. This
 *     attribute has no effect on expanding associative arrays, since a key
 *     already exists for each value in the array.
 *
 *   - Whether form-style parameters are required. When rendering a key/value
 *     pair, it is sometimes permissible to elide the "=" in case the value is
 *     empty. This omission will occur if and only if form-style parameters are
 *     *not* required. Note that this does not effect the case of an undefined
 *     (`null`) value, since such values are implicitly ignored during
 *     expansion.
 *
 *   - The permitted character set for expansions. Any character in a value
 *     which is not in the permitted character set is percent encoded. All
 *     operators permit characters in the "unreserved" set.
 *
 * See [RFC-6570 ยง1.5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570#section-1.5) for the
 * definitions of various character sets.
